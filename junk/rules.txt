RULES OF THE WORLD
----------------------------------------------------


1. TTL = (constant / speed) ^ 1.2 ?

2. Gene properties:
    a) Speed
    b) Vision
    c) GPS
    d) Greed
    e) Reproduction: {}
    f) Competition: {}

3. Each gene property is:

    GProp = {
        props: {},
        mutationRules: {}
    }






GENE properties
----------------------

a) Speed
    Determines length of strides per time step.
    Inversely proportional to TTL (Rule 1).

    MinMax: [1,10]

b) Vision
    Determines how far a creature can see within their FOV
    Inversely proportional to ??
    Advantages:
        i. Food scouting
    
    MinMax: [0,20]

c) GPS
    Determines creature's positional accuracy and confidence
    Affects path home

    (0,1)

d) Greed
    Determines strategy after obtaining X food items
    (Each choice will be probabilistic)

    (0,1)

e) Reproduction
    Determines reproduction properties
    i. Food required (could consider ratio of food:offsprings)
    ii. Birth chance

f) Competition
    Involves interaction with other creatures













TRAIT IDEAS:

Environment variables: poison food, obstacles

TERRAIN!


SINGLE-CREATURE TRAITS: (without interaction)
-------------------------------
1. Hoarder: can store extra food (think of some disadvantage)
2. Time of wake-up: "Early bird" & "Night owl" --------> waking up early, more food available; waking up at night, more stamina
3. Metabolism (food ratios, etc): affects time for next day, or reproduction
4. Selective diet


INTERACTIVE TRAITS:
-------------------------------
1. Aggression: Likelihood of attacking a creature that has food
